    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This simple whole side of salmon with butter, garlic, and fresh herbs is flavorful and foolproof, thanks to roasting it in a foil packet.

        This recipe calls for a butter sauce with garlic, lemon juice, and honey which adds sweetness and brightness to the side of salmon. The baked salmon gets topped with chopped chives, basil, and parsley, adding a touch of freshness at the end.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds whole salmon fillet, skinned</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, grated or finely minced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons honey</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh herbs (basil, chives, or parsley), chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a large-rimmed baking sheet with foil, being sure to leave several inches of overhang on both long ends to make your foil packet.</li><br>
            <li>While the oven preheats, remove the salmon from the fridge to come to temperature, 15-20 minutes. Place the salmon on the prepared pan and pat both sides dry with a paper towel. Feel the flesh for any bones and remove them with fish tweezers or your fingers. </li><br>
            <li>Season both sides of the salmon with salt and pepper.</li><br>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, garlic, honey, and lemon juice. Fold up the edges of the foil to contain the liquid and pour the butter mixture evenly over the top of the salmon.</li><br>
            <li>Bring the two long sides of the foil together and then fold them down a few times to close the top of your packet. Then, tuck each end under to close the sides. If your piece of foil is not large enough, take a second sheet of foil and cover the salmon, pinching the foil to seal the edges.</li><br>
            <li>If you’re cooking farm-raised salmon, it should be done in 18-20 minutes, depending on the thickness. If you’re using wild-caught salmon, check for doneness beginning at 10 minutes. If you open the packet and see the fish isn’t finished cooking, it should be opaque on top and flake easily with a fork, close the foil packet back up, return it to the oven, and check again in another 2-3 minutes.</li><br>
            <li>Carefully open the foil package to uncover the salmon completely, pushing the foil down and out of the way.
                Set the oven to broil on high. If you have an electric stove, return the salmon to the oven, still on the middle rack. Broil the salmon for 2-3 minutes. You’ll see it turn just slightly golden with some charred spots but be sure not to burn the garlic.
                If you have a gas stove, you may want to reduce your broiling time to 1 minute or skip it all together.</li><br>
            <li>Let the salmon rest for about 5 minutes. Garnish with chopped herbs. Transfer to a serving platter or serve directly from the pan!</li>
        </ol>
