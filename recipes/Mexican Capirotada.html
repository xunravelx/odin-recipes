    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>My Grandmaâ€™s Capirotada recipe is simple with not a lot of ingredients. The flavor takes me to another place in time when life was good and my mom was in the kitchen making this dish for us on a Sunday evening during Lent.  Above all, the Mexican bread pudding has warm notes from a beautifully rich syrup of cinnamon, clove, and piloncillo (think brown sugar).</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre heat the oven to 350 degrees</li><br>
        <li>In a medium-sized stockpot, add the water, piloncillo, cinnamon sticks, and cloves over medium-high heat. Allow the piloncillo to completely dissolve and the syrup thickens (about 10 to 15 minutes)</li><br>
        <li>Slice the bolillos about 1/3 inch thick and assemble on a baking sheet. Place in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes to toast</li><br>
        <li>In a deep 9x9 inch baking dish, use some cooking spray on the bottom of the baking dish.</li><br>
        <li>In layers, add the toasted bread, sprinkle raisins, peanuts and cheese. Continue with the next layer until you have a full baking dish adding extra cheese and raisins on top</li><br>
        <li>Spoon the syrup over the assembled dish until all the bread is moist.</li><br>
        <li>Bake for 40 minutes until golden brown.</li><br>
        <li>Enjoy Warm.</li>
